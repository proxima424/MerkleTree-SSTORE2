# MerkleTree-SSTORE2
Hello Anon, try to insert a node in a Merkle Tree with the execution running on EVM.</br>
Did I hear, it costs 1million gassssss?</br>

Will do several optimizations to bring in under control</br>
Starting out with SSTORE2. SSTORE2 is basically storing data in the</br>
runtime bytecode of a contract rather than the contract storage.</br>
So, the only gas costs you need to deal with, is the contract deployment costs.</br>
Refer to README.md of [this repo](https://github.com/0xsequence/sstore2) to look into the exact details.</br>

Will keep updating the gas costs here and thinking of newer ways to bring the GASSS COSTSSS DOWNNNN.</br>
